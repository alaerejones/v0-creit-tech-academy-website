                Creit Tech Academy was born from a simple observation: traditional tech education wasn't working for
                everyone. Large class sizes, generic curriculums, and lack of personalized attention left many talented
                individuals struggling to break into tech.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an extension of Creit Technologies Limited, we leverage years of industry experience to provide what
                we wished we had when starting outâ€”dedicated mentors, hands-on projects, and a clear path from learning
                to employment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're proud to offer one-on-one training across six specialized tech programs, helping students
                build portfolios that prove their skills and land their dream jobs.
